# Hotel Cancellation Prediction

## Method

Using data from kaggle, I looked into if a model could be developed to predict if a case would cancel their hotel reservation. Correlations revealed moderate to strong correlations among several factors such as deposit types. Using those predictors, I fit a logistic regression that predicted cancellation in 78% of test cases. Model predictions are mapped onto the test cases as well as the model confidence levels so stakeholders can see how the model decided if a case going to cancel or not.
